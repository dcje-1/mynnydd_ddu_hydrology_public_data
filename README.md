# Mynydd Ddu Hydrology Study
## Public Data
This repository contains the data from various experimental runs, monitoring water depth and temperature in surface sinks and resurgences related to the Dan yr Ogof cave system in South Wales, UK.

It is the source data for the paper published by the British Cave Research Association, that can be found [here](https://bcra.org.uk/pub/docs/downloads.html?f=cks153101.f).

### Notes on the files
- "SYG" refers to Sinc y Giedd (UK OSGR SN 81040 17920)
- "WFF" refers to Waun Fignen Felen (UK OSGR SN 82522 17733)
- "DYO" refers to Dan yr Ogof cave (UK OSGR SN 83820 16000)

- SYG data was measured upstream from SYG at the Giedd monitoring station (UK OSGR SN 81179 18603)

- WFF data was measured upstream from WFF at the WFF monitoring station (UK OSGR SN 82522 17733)

- DYO data was measured at the main river resurgence at DYO.

In the 2024-2025 data sets, the SYG probe was moved into the river cave and became the compensating barometer for the river cave water depth probe, which may cause confusion.
